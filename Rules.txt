The game will usually be 2 players (Can be updated to 1 player vs computer later):
---------------------------------------------------------------
P1:Snake:
Mission: CATCH HUNTER
-Move using WASD
-Just like in a normal snake game, food lumps will dropped randomly on the map
-The foods have apples and bananas:
+Apple: Eating increases movement speed and body length, helping to catch hunters
+Banana: Eat one more time to use the skill: You can press space to jump in front of you
(Fact: A snake needs to eat about 7 apples to move as fast as a hunter)
----------------------------------------------------------------
P2: Hunter
Mission: Destroy the SNAKE
-Move using the navigation bar
-Gives three bombs at the beginning of the game and glide skill (recovers every 2 seconds).
Left-click to drop a bomb, right-click to glide
-Bombs will also be dropped around the map, you can pick them up to continue dropping bombs
-Bomb:
+Flashes twice after releasing and explodes in a cross pattern
+If it hits the snake's body, it will lose half part of its body and reduce its movement speed
+If it hits the head, it dies!
